# DyNaChem - LASIRE

**Dynamics, Nanoscopy & Chemometrics Research Group**

## About

DyNaChem is a research team within LASIRE (Laboratoire Avancé de Spectroscopie pour les Interactions, la Réactivité et l'Environnement), UMR CNRS 8516, at the University of Lille, France.

## Research Focus

Our team specializes in:

- **Micro- and nano-imaging** of photoactive bio-systems
- **Photochemistry & photodynamics** of molecules, proteins, and emissive organic and hybrid nanoparticles for super-resolution fluorescence biological imaging
- **Hyperspectral & super-resolved** nanometer-scale imaging of ultrafast processes
- Development of new **instrumentation and methodologies** for analyzing hyperspectral super-resolved data
- **Chemometric approaches** for multivariate data analysis in spectroscopy and imaging

## Location

**LASIRE - University of Lille**
Cité Scientifique
F-59000 Lille, France
